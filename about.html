<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I manage 6 Code Nation programs in San Francisco and Oakland. I love hiking, baseball, and yoga.</p>

<p>I grew up in Fresno, CA and attended UC Santa Cruz. I studied Linguistics and Computer Science.
At the time, I was curious about dialogue systems like Siri and Alexa and how they worked.
I have always loved volunteering and giving back to my community.
I wanted to pursue a meaningful career so I became a teacher.
I taught secondary math in Las Vegas, NV for three years before learning about Code Nation.
I wanted to increase my impact and break into computer science education.</p>
